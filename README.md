#### This project is an autonomous and bluetooth controlled car project developed within the scope of the Microprocessor Based Controllers course of the computer engineering department. The codes of the project are written in C++ language.

### Code definitions

 There are two main functions in the code: setup() and loop(). setup() runs once when the program starts and usually sets up initial settings. loop() contains continuously repeating operations and runs over and over again as long as the program is running.

 Additionally, the Serial library was used in the project. The Serial library establishes serial communication and sets certain pins as input or output. 

 Functions like digitalWrite, analogWrite, pinMode are specific to Arduino and are used to control the states of microcontroller pins.
